  Personas Database — v1
  ---------------------------------
  Purpose: Provide a comprehensive, hand‑curated set of personas for Prompt Builder / Persona Builder.
  Format: Plain JS that attaches PERSONAS to window (browser) and module.exports (Node/CommonJS) for flexibility.

  Minimal schema used by v1 UI (others can be tucked under `meta` and ignored by v1):

  {
    id: string,                  // slug/id used for lookups (kebab-case)
    name: string,                // human label (shown in the picker)
    profession: string,          // broad profession or discipline
    summary: string,             // 1–2 lines summary
    description?: string,        // optional, longer narrative
    core_tasks: string[],        // 3–8 short task verbs/phrases
    skills: string[],            // core abilities/competencies
    vocabulary: string[],        // domain terms/jargon (stingy + precise)
    goals: string[],             // common success targets
    pain_points: string[],       // recurring blockers/frictions
    tools: string[],             // common tools/platforms
    tags: string[],              // key:value chips to power typeahead & filters
    mappings: {                  // external taxonomies (optional)
      esco_occupation?: string,
      onetsoc?: string,
      iscocode?: string
    },
    meta?: {                     // ignored by v1; free real-estate for later
      seniority?: string[],      // e.g., ["junior","mid","senior","lead"]
      industries?: string[],
      synonyms?: string[]        // extra search hooks
