/*
  Biases / Stereotypes / Ethics Library — v1
  ------------------------------------------
  Purpose: Curate biases, stereotypes, LLM-specific biases, mitigation techniques, and ethical dilemmas
           in a single, searchable dataset for Prompt Builder.

  Minimal schema used by v1 UI / scripts (others can live under `meta` and be ignored by v1):

  {
    id: string,              // kebab-case stable id (used for lookups/relations)
    name: string,            // human label (picker/display)
    kind: string,            // 'bias' | 'stereotype' | 'llm-bias' | 'technique' | 'dilemma'
    category: string,        // broad family (e.g., 'cognitive','cultural','ai','ethics')
    summary: string,         // 1–2 lines quick definition
    definition?: string,     // longer description/narrative
    mechanisms?: string[],   // how it operates / cognitive or structural drivers
    indicators?: string[],   // cues/phrases/patterns that hint it’s present
    contexts?: string[],     // where it commonly appears (domains, workflows)
    harms?: string[],        // typical impacts/risks
    mitigations?: string[],  // practical countermeasures or checks
    examples?: string[],     // short, neutral examples (1 line each)
    related?: string[],      // ids of related items in this file
    tags?: string[],         // key:value chips for search/filters (e.g., 'class:cognitive','domain:research')
    mappings?: {             // external taxonomies/refs (optional)
      wikipedia?: string,
      wikidata?: string
    },
    meta?: {
      synonyms?: string[],   // extra search hooks
      search_text?: string   // set automatically at load — do not hand-edit
    }
  }

  Export style: identical to persona.data.js (IIFE, attach to window + module.exports).
