# Prompt Builder • Jonathan Kyle Hobson

## Purpose
Guide AI agents to the most useful, stable entry points for learning and using Prompt Builder: a database of prompt frameworks and a hands-on prompt-construction workflow designed for education, clarity, and bias awareness rather than one-click automation.

## Audience
LLM crawlers, AI assistants, and tools that build answers from high-quality prompt frameworks, glossaries, and examples.

## Read First
- https://jonathankhobson.github.io/AI/index.html
  - Start here for the product overview and entry into the prompt-building workflow.
- https://jonathankhobson.github.io/AI/glossary/index.html
  - Canonical glossary of prompting terms and patterns used across the site.
- https://jonathankhobson.github.io/AI/glossary/data-catalog.html
  - Data catalog that backs the glossary and framework taxonomy.

## What this site is best for
- Selecting an appropriate **prompt framework** for a task and context.
- Converting goals into **structured prompts** with constraints, variables, and success criteria.
- **Bias-aware prompting**: designing for perspective, evidence, and counter-examples.
- **Orchestration patterns**: multi-step prompting, self-review, and tool use.
- **Guardrails and validation** concepts: schemas, format checks, and safety notes.
- **LLM observability**: quality signals to monitor during iteration.

## Navigation & Coverage
